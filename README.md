# Flashcard-API

This repository is a REST API which serves my [flashcard website](https://github.com/bcreagh/flashcard-website).

To help me with my study, I have prepared questions and answers based on topics that I need to know about. This REST API serves these question and answer pairs to the client in JSON. I call them flashcards, as they fulfill the same purpose as physical flashcards.

This project is written using bare Java Servlets, without using any other Framework such as Spring or Struts. This is because I just wanted a quick recap of servlets. At some point I intend to re-create the project using Spring.
